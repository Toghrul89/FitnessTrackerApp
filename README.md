FitnessTrackerApp

Description

A simple Android app to help users set workout goals, track time, and view progress. Built in Kotlin using Android Studio/Visual Studio Code, this project demonstrates core Android concepts like activity navigation, data storage, and a clean user interface.

Note: This app was originally created as a team project at Seattle Central College as part of our Software Development program. I later continued improving it individually by adding saved goals, UI polish, and better app structure.
